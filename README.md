The above are a few examples of my writing and my research. I extend the Weighted Balanced Theory by adding the possibility of networks. For more on the code, see the repository [here](https://github.com/zach-porter/ABM-Networked-Weighted-Balance-Theory). I also analysing Granovetters Strength of Weak Ties, how the theory has been extended, the critisms brought against it, and how it can still be applied today.
